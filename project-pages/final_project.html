          In order to find the sequence of 2D points in a video, we must define coordinates. There are various ways of obtaining these keypoints. I manually found coordinates for those keypoints. Then I measured the length, width, and height of its box and turned each one of them into 3D coordinates. First, I defined 20 key points and set point 0 as origin for 3D coordinates.

        <div class="body-text">
          There are several ways to propagate points from the first frame to subsequent frames. I chose to use the Harris Corner Detector as I drew a checker pattern on the box and thought it would work well. So for each frame, even though it is not using the previous frame's key points, it is able to detect corners.

        <div class="body-text">
          Next, as you may have noticed, there are too many points that are not related to the box. So I sample points that have high Harris matrix values; otherwise, I discard them. After that process, it looks much better but is still not using the previous frame's coordinates.

          It captures corners much better, and they are something we can use. So, the next step I took was to calculate the cost using the Euclidean distance between the previous coordinates and the current coordinates. I set a threshold to determine if the distance was too far away; if it was, I discarded it. After this process, it properly uses the previous frame's coordinates and propagates the correct next key points. Point 5 and 14 were lost along the way, but we were able to get other coordinates properly. Also, I colored the origin point to blue.

          We first get the data from Stanford Light Field Archive. The set of images are taken in different position with slight different angles, but I used one that are recified and cropped. This essentially enables refocusing and aperture adjustment by capturing mutliple images on a grid perpendicular to the optical axis. We will show aperture adjustment in later.

          This adjustment can be done by varying the light field images used for averaging. This implementation is relatively simpler compared to the previous section. All we need to do is take fewer images by checking with the radius. Additionally, I used (8, 8) as the center of the image. As you can see, as the aperture number increases, the background blurs, focusing on a specific part of the image.

          For the Lighted Camera B&W, I implemented interactive refocusing. When you run the code, it will prompt you to pinpoint a focus point. Then, it calculates the optimal depth level and uses refocusing to adjust the focus accordingly. To obtain the correct depth, I calculate the point's coordinates and convert them into the corresponding depth level. I then used the previous implementation to achieve the correct focus.
