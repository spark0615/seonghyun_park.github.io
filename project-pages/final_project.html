          The `FaceCNN` model is a CNN designed for facial recognition or related tasks, accepting single-channel grayscale images as input. It has six convolutional layers with increasing channel depths, starting from 16 and reaching 64. Each convolutional layer uses a kernel size of 3, with varying padding values (3, 2, or 1) to control the output dimensions. After each convolution, a max pooling layer with a kernel size and stride of 2 reduces the spatial dimensions by half. The architecture includes an optional sixth convolutional layer for added complexity. Following the convolutional layers, the output is flattened to a 1D tensor and passed through three fully connected layers, which reduce dimensions sequentially from 256 to 200, 150, and finally 116. The output is reshaped into a `(58, 2)` tensor. ReLU activation functions are applied after each convolution and fully connected layer, except the output. For training, I used a learning rate of 1e^-3 and batch size of 4.

          The heatmaps generated by the function are based on a Gaussian distribution, with the mean centered at the specified keypoint coordinates \((x_0, y_0)\). The spread of the Gaussian is determined by the standard deviation (\(\sigma\)), which defaults to 8.0, resulting in a variance of 64. Each heatmap is computed using the formula \(\text{heatmap}(x, y) = \exp\left(-\frac{(x - x_0)^2 + (y - y_0)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)\), ensuring the highest intensity at the keypoint and a smooth decrease with increasing distance. A mesh grid of size \((\text{height}, \text{width})\) is used to calculate the squared Euclidean distance for all grid points relative to the keypoints. The function normalizes each heatmap so that the maximum value is 1 and sets heatmaps corresponding to out-of-bounds keypoints to zero.

          This U-Net model consists of four levels, each containing two convolutional layers with batch normalization and a ReLU activation function, along with a max-pooling layer in the encoder. In the decoder, the max-pooling layers are replaced with up-convolutional layers. The convolutional filter counts for each block are 32, 64, 128, and 256, respectively, with the bottleneck layer using 512 filters. Skip connections link the encoding layers to their corresponding decoding layers. The input to the model is a 3-channel image and the output channel is 68. The model outputs a 68-channel probability heatmap thatâ€™s of the same size as the input image.

          There are several ways to propagate points from the first frame to subsequent frames. I chose to use the Harris Corner Detector as I drew a checker pattern on the box and thought it would work well. So for each frame, even though it is not using the previous frame's key points, it is able to detect corners.

          It captures corners much better, and they are something we can use. So, the next step I took was to calculate the cost using the Euclidean distance between the previous coordinates and the current coordinates. I set a threshold to determine if the distance was too far away; if it was, I discarded it. After this process, it properly uses the previous frame's coordinates and propagates the correct next key points. Point 5 and 14 were lost along the way, but we were able to get other coordinates properly. Also, I colored the origin point to blue.

          Now that we have both continuous 2D coordinates and 3D coordinates, we map the 3D points in homogeneous coordinates to 2D image points. Using the matrix below, we can solve the system of equations. By applying least squares, we obtain the projection matrix to calibrate the camera.

        <div class="body-text">
          We first get the data from Stanford Light Field Archive. The set of images are taken in different position with slight different angles, but I used one that are recified and cropped. This essentially enables refocusing and aperture adjustment by capturing mutliple images on a grid perpendicular to the optical axis. We will show aperture adjustment in later.
        </div>

        <div class="body-text">
          For each image, we compute a shift vector based on depth of focus and apply the shift to achieve the target depth.

          This adjustment can be done by varying the light field images used for averaging. This implementation is relatively simpler compared to the previous section. All we need to do is take fewer images by checking with the radius. Additionally, I used (8, 8) as the center of the image. As you can see, as the aperture number increases, the background blurs, focusing on a specific part of the image.

        <div class="body-text">
          From this project, I was able to learn about lightfields and their applications in computational photography. It was interesting to see how simply shifting and averaging images can create different depths of focus and adjust the aperture.

        <div class="subheader-text ">Bells and Whistles</div>
        
        <div class="body-text">
          For the Lighted Camera B&W, I implemented interactive refocusing. When you run the code, it will prompt you to pinpoint a focus point. Then, it calculates the optimal depth level and uses refocusing to adjust the focus accordingly. To obtain the correct depth, I calculate the point's coordinates and convert them into the corresponding depth level. I then used the previous implementation to achieve the correct focus.
